# Casting-a-Robot-Arm-
(Smart Methods Internship) In this repo i casted a robot arm using CINEMA 4D, casting is usually used when we want to produce so many objects and to choose our own material, here i would like to use a solid material so people can handshake with the robot without breaking the arm.

I used Boole technique and built the cylindrical holes to pour the solid material.
